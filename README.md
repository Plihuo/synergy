## FAQ

### How do I build the source code?
If you're a customer, you generally don’t need to build Synergy yourself as we provide pre-built, tested releases.
However, if you're a customer looking to build Synergy from source, [contact us](https://symless.com/synergy/contact) so we can help with that.
If you're a developer looking to contribute to an open source community, join us in our [Deskflow](https://deskflow.org) project.

### What’s the difference between Synergy and Deskflow?
Synergy is a stable, supported commercial product. It is quality assurance tested, has a warranty, and is maintained by a team of full-time engineers.
Deskflow is the upstream project where the open source community, including Synergy engineers, prototype and iterate on new features.
Synergy is your business-ready solution; Deskflow is for open source contributors and early adopters.

### Where should I file bugs or feature requests?
For supported customers, reach out to our [support team](https://symless.com/synergy/contact) and we’ll triage and track issues internally.
If you're contributing to the community project, use [Deskflow issues](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/issues) to report bugs or request features.

### Can I contribute code to Synergy?
We welcome contributions, but our community development happens upstream in Deskflow. 
That’s the best place to propose changes and collaborate with the wider community. 
Changes flow downstream to Synergy once they have matured enough and are ready for customer usage.

### How often does Deskflow merge into Synergy?
We regularly port stable features and fixes from Deskflow into Synergy.
This involves QA, integration testing, and compliance review. Critical bug fixes are fast-tracked.
For specific timelines on particular bug fixes and features, please [get in touch](https://symless.com/synergy/contact).

### Is Deskflow stable?
Deskflow is intended for developers and contributors who can self-support and fix issues.
It’s not suitable for production or business-critical environments requiring stability guarantees.
For those cases, we recommend using Synergy.

### Why have two projects?
This model lets us move fast without breaking things. Deskflow empowers rapid community-driven innovation.
Synergy delivers a stable, supported experience to customers.
